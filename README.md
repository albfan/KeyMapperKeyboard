100% FOSS keyboard, forked from [OpenBoard](https://github.com/dslul/openboard), which is forked from the AOSP keyboard.

A huge thank you to [@dslul](https://github.com/dslul), who made this project possible! üòÅ Otherwise,
I would have had to spend a long time figuring out how to make the AOSP keyboard compile out of tree and make
dictionaries work.

## Contributing
Contribute to the [OpenBoard](https://github.com/dslul/openboard) project if it isn't a fix for the Key Mapper integration.

I will make any bug fixes or add features that are useful to people who don't use Key Mapper I will make pull requests in
OpenBoard.
